## Introduction

Ascension is a web-based application (made with Vue.js) to simplify esports teams management activities. This is a currently undergoing side-project for an international esports organization based in Germany. While this application functionalities are tailored for a certain organization's needs, I am intending to make this application as an open-source starter project that can be reused by others for a similar purpose.

## Functionalities
This project came with standard functionalities such as:
1. Organizing the team's upcoming scrimmage and tournament schedules.
2. View overview rosters data for each team.
3. View profile detail data for each player.
4. View both scrimmage and tournament results from each team.
5. ... More functionalities will be added in the future.
